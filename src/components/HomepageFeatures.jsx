       <p>Kubernetes was originally designed to run stateless workloads. Today, it is increasingly used to run databases and other stateful workloads. Yet despite the success of these early adopters, there remain <b>few known good practices for running data on Kubernetes.</b></p>
       <p>After discussions with thousands of companies and individuals running data workloads on Kubernetes weâ€™ve come to see that there is a need for a sharing of patterns and concerns about how to build and operate data-centric applications on Kubernetes. As a result, <b>the Data on Kubernetes Community (DoKC) was born.</b></p>
       <p> DoKC is an openly governed group of curious and experienced practitioners, taking inspiration from the CNCF and Apache Software Foundation.<b> Our aim is to assist in the emergence and development of techniques for the use of Kubernetes for data.</b></p>
